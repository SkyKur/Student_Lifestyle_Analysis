/*
1️⃣ Moderate stress may not drive academic success

Almost no "Above Average" GPA students in the Moderate Stress group.
Could suggest that a little stress is beneficial, but too much is counterproductive.
2️⃣ High stress doesn’t guarantee high performance

Despite high stress levels, only 94 students in this category achieved "Above Average" GPA.
Indicates stress alone is not the key factor for success.
3️⃣ Low stress may lead to disengagement from studies

Majority of Low-Stress students have Fair GPAs.
Could mean that too little stress leads to a lack of motivation or discipline.

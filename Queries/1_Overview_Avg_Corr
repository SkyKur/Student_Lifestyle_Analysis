Study hours drive both higher stress and higher GPA.
More sleep might help reduce stress but won’t necessarily boost GPA.
Social and extracurricular activities don’t majorly impact GPA but could provide mental balance.
Physical activity may help lower stress but could negatively impact GPA if too time-consuming.

✅ For Students Who Want to Reduce Stress:

Consider reducing excessive study hours and focusing on efficient learning strategies.
Improve sleep routines as it might help in stress management.
Engage in physical activity, even though the effect is not strong.
✅ For Students Who Want to Improve GPA:

Study time matters the most—students should prioritize effective study habits.
Sleep does not impact GPA, but a balanced routine is still good for well-being.
Physical activity and social life should be balanced, as excessive involvement might 
reduce academic performance.
